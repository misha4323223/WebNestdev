# WebNestdev

Web-native evolution of the NestDev agent architecture.

## Architecture

Browser -> Fastify API/WebSocket -> Agent Runtime -> OpenAI-compatible Provider -> Tool Registry -> Project Sandbox -> Preview/Deployment

The Electron NestDev project remains separate and is not modified.

## AI provider

The web version uses an OpenAI-compatible API. Configure the provider with a Base URL, optional API key, and model. This supports hosted providers and compatible gateways without requiring a local model runtime.

## Security boundary

Agent commands run through a Docker sandbox by default.

Each command gets only the project workspace, a read-only container root, isolated network by default, CPU/memory/PID limits, a timeout, and bounded output. Provider credentials are not passed into the sandbox.

## Current implementation status

The agent can start a Docker-based project Preview and inspect the running service with project.verify and browser.open.

Preview inspection uses the actual host port assigned to the project, rather than assuming port 3000. This matters because different projects may expose different ports.

browser.open returns the HTTP status, status text, response headers, content type, and a bounded response body. project.verify uses the same Preview state and performs an HTTP-level readiness check.

The current verification layer validates that a Preview is actually serving HTTP. The next runtime milestone is to extend browser inspection with richer runtime diagnostics (console/runtime errors, failed network requests, and screenshots) and then connect those signals to an automatic fix/retry loop in the Agent Runtime.

## Roadmap

- persistent projects and conversations
- Git/GitHub integration
- live preview workers
- browser worker
- Yandex Cloud resource/deployment tools
- authentication and secrets
- sponsor service with privacy isolation
- usage limits, moderation and abuse protection

## Local development

The repository uses npm workspaces, so the frontend and backend dependencies are installed from the repository root.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development UI runs on port 5173 and the API on port 8787. Vite proxies /api and /ws to the API during local development.

## Local accounts

WebNestDev now uses a real local authentication flow before opening the workspace:

- register with email and password;
- login and logout;
- HTTP-only session cookie;
- password hashing with salted scrypt;
- projects and conversations are scoped to the authenticated user.

Local account data is stored under .webnestdev/auth. This is a development storage layer; production storage will move to managed infrastructure without changing the user-facing flow.

See docs/AUTH_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md for the staged rollout.
